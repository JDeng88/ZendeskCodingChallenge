There are issues with the deployment that may make it so that the link dosn't work when you are viewing this. Here is how to run the program locally.

1. Have node.js installed
2. clone the repository
3. run npm install in the root and client directory
4. run 'node server.js' in the root directory
5. run 'npm start' in the client directory

Please note that this requires ports 8888 and 3000 to be available.
