Zendesk Coding Challenge for 2022 Summer Internship

As of 2 hours before the deadline, I am having issues deploying my application. If the link dosn't work, another way to run it is to clone the repository and run 'node server.js' in the root directory and 'npm start' in the client directory. This should automatically open a tab in a brwoser, but should also be accessible on localhost:3000 if it dosnt. This also requires ports 3000 and 8888 to be free if run locally.
